This part can be used to reference terms you don't know, but is not necessary for completing the lab. You should skim it.

What is Linux?

Linux is an operating system that is free to the public to download, since it was created as an open-source program. The system is based on an older OS version called UNIX. To navigate through a Linux or UNIX system, you need to type in instructions to the computer using what is called a command-line prompt (nowadays, we often use graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to click on folders instead of typing commands to find those folders). You can even download software using the command-line prompt. Later, you will learn some of the most common Linux commands.

What is Ubuntu?

It is an African word meaning "the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(philosophy)).

More seriously, it is a version of Linux. Some of the most popular distributions include names like Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, openSUSE, and Debian, though there are dozens more. Ubuntu is known for being kind to beginners with its software center and media management while Debian is less user friendly and geared towards more technically oriented users. We will be using Ubuntu for our OS. In fact, we have created an Ubuntu version specifically for this class!

What is a Virtual Machine (VM)?

A virtual machine is an application that can imitate hardware such that you can run more than one operating system on your own computer. For example, I can run Windows on a Mac computer using a virtual machine. The VM can run while my usual operating system running without requiring a reboot. It works like any other application, sitting in a window you can minimize when you want to go on Facebook and maximize when you want to work on CS 3410 again. In case you hear this terminology, the Host OS refers to your computer, while the Guest OS is the operating system you are running on the VM.

(So why do people use dual booting? Well, one reason is that VMs tend to have higher overhead, such as being slow with 3D graphics, but booting one OS at a time means that the OS can use the computerâ€™s full speed.)
